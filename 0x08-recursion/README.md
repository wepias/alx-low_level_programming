In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

Task 0

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

Task 1

Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

Task 2

Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

Task 3

Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1

Task 4

Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

Task 5
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Task 6
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
